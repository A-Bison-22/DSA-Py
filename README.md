Hey guys Good afternoon
If you for some reason have been reading my repos' readme.md; you would know that i have abandoned C++ on the advice of my mentors and will be pursuing the same in Python instead.
Honestly what a bummber because i was just getting accustomed to the language.
It's all good tho who gaf.
